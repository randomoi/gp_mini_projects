Project: Noisy Grid
Student Name: https://github.com/randomoi

Completed basic requirements and added two extensions:
	1. Extension: changed color of the colorGrid and changed style of the compassGrid line;
	2. Extension: color and length of the compass line change with noise();

NOTE: I wanted to achieve smooth 3D transition of the compass lines. The selected values were a balance between the provided GIF and personal goal.
