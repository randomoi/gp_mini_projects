Project: Average Face
Student Name: https://github.com/randomoi

Completed basic requirements and added two extensions:

    1. Changed the code so that the image drawn on the left is a random face from the array of faces rather than just the first one, with a new random face selected using the keyPressed() function.

    2. On mouse moved the pixel values of the second image transition between the randomly selected image and the average image based on the mouseX value.
  
Testing: Tested the program in Google Chrome.
