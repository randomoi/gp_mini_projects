Project: Webcam Piano
Student Name: https://github.com/randomoi

Completed basic requirements and added four extensions:
	1. Customized the base grid graphics by changing from circles to squares. Used for loop to create 5 overlapping squares, which are filled with random colors (retains until the program is refreshed). 
	2. Secondary graphics effects are triggered when an active note is drawn. 
	3. Implemented the core p5.js sound library to play sounds depending on which “note” in the grid is activated. Included the user interaction function for starting the audio context to make sure  audio works across all browsers.
	4. Implement a custom “Note” class that is used in Grid.js. Also, implemented another custom class "NoteBar" for the secondary graphics.

Testing: Tested the program in Google Chrome.
